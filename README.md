# Jumps-and-returns-Placement-of-ships
There is a game in which players need to deploy ships on the battlefield. Let's build a program to figure out where ships can be placed.

We have a field with 5 rows (X) and 5 columns (Y), 25 cells in total. Write a program that reads the coordinates (X, Y) of three one-cell-sized ships and prints all the available rows (X) and columns (Y) for new ships. New ships can be placed only in the rows and columns which are vacant, so you need to print out the indices of rows and columns with no ships in them.

Print the rows (X) and columns (Y) on two different lines (the list of empty rows on the first line and the list of empty columns on the next line). All the output coordinates should be separated with a space. Do not add extra spaces at the end of the output lines.
